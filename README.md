jimmysoda is Jaime Soto
=======================

I write software for fun and for a living. I hope you find something useful in my GitHub repositories.

Experience
----------

My primary software development language has been C++ and I also have some professional experience with
Java and C. I've dabbled with Matlab during my graduate coursework on image processing and computer vision and
with Python on simple utility scripts for work and on personal projects.

I am the founder of [Simverge](https://simverge.com), a small software development business in the Orlando area
that focuses on synthetic environment creation and reasoning for simulations and games.

I previously worked at [ARA](https://ara.com) for eleven years, where I started as a junior software engineer and 
_climbed the ranks_ to a senior software engineer.
I was a member of [Virtual Heroes](https://virtualheroes.com) division on my last few years at ARA.
I worked mostly on creating tools for creating simulation and gaming terrains from GIS data
such as elevation rasters, satellite images, and vector features (e.g., road lines, building footprints,
tree points, etc).

I hold a [Modeling and Simulation master's degree](http://catalog.ucf.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=4&poid=1387)
under the _Computer Visualization_ focus area and a
[Computer Engineering bachelor's degree](http://ucf.catalog.acalog.com/preview_program.php?catoid=3&poid=713) from the
[University of Central Florida](https://ucf.edu). I also attended [Valencia College](httpd://valenciacollege.edu) 
for my [pre-major associate's degree](http://catalog.valenciacollege.edu/degrees/associateinarts/premajorsatvalencia/engineering/).

Why jimmysoda?
--------------

The name arose from an unintended _broken telephone_ effect during my days as a community college student.
I participated in an event that required me to write my name on a roster and be called later.
Note that my first name is roughly pronounced as _HI-meh_ in Spanish, and I understand that it may be mistaken
for the English name _Jamie_ and pronounced as _JAY-mee_. It seems that my name was read aloud
and rewritten, because I was called _Jimmy Soda_ as written on a new roster. I embraced this new name
with enthusiasm.
